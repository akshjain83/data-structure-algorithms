# C++ Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
This repository focuses on object-oriented methodologies in designing and implementing a variety of data structures and algorithms. Coverage includes recursion, trees, search structures, hashing, heaps, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms. The program goes through data structures and algorithms combinations which are even analyzed along with their relative merits using both mathematical and empirical measurements. The repository consists of programming assignments focusing on object-oriented software engineering and algorithm development.
The programming assignments are implemented using C++.
